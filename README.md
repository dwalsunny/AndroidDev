# Pathfinder with A*

This repository contains some of the work done for the application.  Unfortuently, some of the files to the project have been lost with time.  It has all files supporting an android navagation app, with a pedometer, known displacement, and a map.  

Main Functionality:

  The user selects a starting and ending location, then the program draws the shortest path from the two points using the A* path finding alogrithm.  As you proceed your path, the app tracks your movement, steps, and displacement.
